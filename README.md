# NYC-Flu-Vaccination-Center-Visualization
This is an exploratory data visualization of flu vaccine centers in New York City. 
I attempted to identify any over and underserved areas in the city. I used this project to learn GeoPandas.
I've included the original data sets in here, as well as links to the sources in the jupyter notebook. 
The dependencies include GeoPandas and all sub-dependencies (more info in the notebook).
